			<span class="box-body">"In particular, the aesthetics of "The Story of Maggie Happyjack and Simon Etapp of Waswanipi" piqued my interest and made me want to translate it into Chinese. Maggie and Simon’s story — like  others in the <i>Sweet Bloods</i> collection — does not have an exciting plot. Instead, the calm, steady unfolding of the life stories of Simon and Maggie reminds me of the slow, rhythmic sound of spinning yarn. Its peaceful tone — contrasted by the violence of residential schools and the tragic diabetic aftermath — renders the story strangely powerful."<br><br>

			<span class="box-body">"I was very emotional as I translated Jennifer’s story. I felt compassion for her when she talked about her weight and how her boyfriend treated her. I felt her pain and frustration having to deal with confusion, uncertainty, stress, and feeling rejected and unloved. She had a lot on her plate. Her weight, drinking, drugs, her boyfriend leaving her and their four children and then to be told she was diabetic."<br><br>

	          <span class="box-body">"Since the original publication of Sweet Bloods, we’ve embarked on a number of related projects. For instance, we recorded the book into audio format. The reader is Cree artist/musician Matthew Iserhoff of Juno-winning group CerAmony. Iserhoff lives in a Cree and Inuit community on Hudson Bay called Whapmagoostui or Kuujjuarapik, depending on whether you’re on the Cree or Inuit side of town. The community has no connecting roads, no cell reception, and limited bandwidth, so we couldn’t use the usual file-sharing technologies."<br><br>

	          <span class="box-body">"<i>The author chose to write up Sweet Bloods in a short story format rather than word-for-word interviews, and this makes it highly readable. The stories are interspersed with “Stories We Heard Along The Way”, brief notes that the author has gathered and arranged under different topics. These typically have nothing to do with diabetes but serve to give the reader some insight into the difficult way of life the James Bay Cree struggle to exist under due to colonization, the James Bay hydroelectric project, and the advancement of Western technology.</i>"</span>

According to The Sweet Bloods of Eeyou Istchee, every family in the traditional territory of the James Bay Cree is directly affected by diabetes, which has an impact not only on their physical health but on their financial and cultural health as well.</i>"</span>

"It's not a simple pill or injection. It involves the cost of food, the housing, the social structures, the traditional teachings, the animals on the land."</span>
